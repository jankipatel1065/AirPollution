# Air Pollution Analysis with Pig 🐷 and Spark ⚡

## Project Overview

This project harnesses the capabilities of Apache Pig and Apache Spark to conduct a detailed analysis of air pollution data. The dataset encompasses crucial parameters such as pollution levels, AQI (Air Quality Index), hospital admissions, and more across diverse cities and states. The primary objective is to extract meaningful insights and trends related to air quality, providing valuable information for researchers, policymakers, and environmentalists.

## Technologies Used

- **Apache Pig** 🐷: Utilized for data loading, cleaning, and initial analysis. Pig's high-level scripting language simplifies the expression of data analysis programs, making it ideal for large-scale data processing.

- **Apache Spark** ⚡: Employed for more complex and scalable data processing tasks. Spark's distributed computing capabilities enhance the project's efficiency in handling extensive datasets and performing advanced analytics.

## Project Highlights

- 📊 **City-wise Pollution Analysis:** Identified cities with the highest pollution levels using Pig. Grouped data by city and determined the maximum pollution level, offering localized insights.

- 🗺️ **State-wise Pollution Analysis:** Explored states with the highest pollution levels. Utilized Pig to group data by state and find the maximum pollution level, contributing to a broader understanding of regional air quality trends.

- 📅 **Year-wise Analysis:** Calculated average pollution levels and hospital admissions for each year, providing insights into temporal patterns and variations over time.

- 🌬️ **Pollutant-specific Analysis:** Analyzed specific pollutants such as carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen using Pig, offering a detailed examination of their trends over the years.

- 🌐 **Advanced Analysis with Spark (Optional):** Leveraged Spark's capabilities for more complex computations and scalability, enhancing the project's analytical prowess.

## Conclusion

By combining the strengths of Apache Pig and Apache Spark, this project provides a robust framework for comprehensive air pollution analysis. The modular design allows for easy adaptation to different datasets or additional analysis requirements. The insights derived can play a crucial role in shaping environmental policies and addressing air quality challenges effectively.
